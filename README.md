## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned more about working with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for storing data to access between components.

### Continued development

I want to continue to focus on digging deeper into State Managment using Pinia as well as refining my knowledge of Vue 3 Composition API.
